<h2>MY INTERESTS ARE:</h2>
<P>I will give you 3...</P>
<br />
<p>Gem collecting (1), cross stitching (2), and programming (3)!!!</p>
<br />
<h3>3 points, one per each interest:</h3>
<p>1.  Gem collecting: Gems are rare, and with how good China's synthetic gems are, gem identification is really a craft.</p>
<p>2.  Cross stitching: Cross stitch is needle work done by hand.  To date there is no machine that can replicate the cross stitch.</p>
<p>3.  Programming: I am new to programming, but so far it is pretty fun!</p>
